## 🎭 Shared Themes

All playable characters share these core elements:

### Identity & Inheritance
- Born into modern world, unaware of bloodline
- Society buried their true identities under false names
- Rage/fury as fire burning away false layers
- Discovery of ancestral warrior heritage

### The Cycle
- Each fights independently, unaware of others
- All face similar triggers (corruption, loss, injustice)
- All must learn violence perpetuates the cycle
- Understanding replaces fury as true weapon

### Philosophical Journey
1. **Descent** (Eckhart/Jung) - Confront darkness
2. **Cycle** (Buddha) - Recognize pattern
3. **Identity** (Game Motto) - True self emerges
4. **Balance** (Resolution) - Become balancer, not destroyer

---

## 🎮 Combat Design Philosophy

### Three Skill Sets Per Hero
Every playable character features three distinct combat styles:

1. **Barehand/Core Style** - Character's natural fighting method
2. **Close-Range Weapon** - Specialized weapon type
3. **Heavy/Extended Weapon** - Alternative playstyle

This triples variety and replayability per character.

### Design Goals
- **Accessibility:** Easy to learn, rewarding to master
- **Distinctiveness:** Each character feels unique
- **Depth:** Multiple viable builds and strategies
- **Narrative Integration:** Combat reflects personality

---
