## 🎭 Character Identity

### Core Concept
*"A gentle giant pushed beyond his breaking point—a humanist forced to become a force of nature."*

Cengiz embodies the game's central theme: a person whose true self has been buried under societal expectations. Born and raised in France to Turkish immigrant parents, he grew up straddling two worlds—never fully French, never fully Turkish. His natural temperament is peaceful, rational, and compassionate. But when the game begins, that gentle soul has been consumed by righteous fury.

### The Duality
- **Before (Hidden Self):** Calm, thoughtful, humanitarian, conflict-avoidant
- **Now (Surface Self):** Explosive rage, relentless violence, pure fury
- **True Self (Inheritance):** Warrior blood of Hulagu Khan awakening through fire

### Physical Presence
Cengiz is **heavily built** with the physique of a natural warrior:
- Broad shoulders and powerful frame
- Dense muscle mass built through physical labor (construction work)
- Hands scarred from honest work, now weapons themselves
- Carries weight and power in every movement
- **Visual Identity:** Imposing but not aggressive—until he moves

---

## 🌍 Background & History

### Early Life (Paris-born)
- **Born:** Paris, France to Turkish immigrant parents
- **Childhood:** Grew up in working-class neighborhoods
- **Cultural Identity:** Struggled to fit in—too Turkish for French society, too French for Turkish community
- **Education:** Practical trades, construction work
- **Personality:** Developed calm, diplomatic nature to navigate between worlds

### Pre-Game Life
- **Occupation:** Construction worker (heavy labor, honest work)
- **Community Role:** Mediator, helper, the guy everyone trusts
- **Philosophy:** Believed in dialogue, understanding, peaceful resolution
- **Reputation:** "The gentle giant"—strong but never violent
- **Relationships:** Tight-knit with local community, both Turkish and French neighbors

### The Breaking Point
*[What triggered Cengiz's rage is discovered through reverse narrative]*

At game start, Cengiz is already **at peak fury**:
- Something shattered his peaceful worldview
- His humanist ideals proved insufficient
- The corruption spreading through Paris touched him personally
- His girlfriend's death is the catalyst (revealed gradually)

**Current Mental State:**
- Pure, burning rage
- No more diplomacy, no more patience
- Action replaces words
- Violence becomes his language

---

## 💪 Combat Profile

### Fighting Philosophy
Cengiz doesn't fight with technique—he fights with **explosive power**. His fury amplifies his natural strength into something terrifying. Every strike carries the weight of his rage and his powerful build.

**Combat Approach:**
- Raw power over finesse
- Overwhelming force
- Relentless pressure
- Environment as weapon

### Skill Sets

#### 🥊 **Barehand (Brawling)**
*"Your fists were meant to build. Now they destroy."*

**Style:** Pure physical dominance through hand-to-hand combat

**Barehand Identity:** This is Cengiz at his most primal—no weapons, no tools, just flesh and fury colliding with the world. His construction-worker hands become hammers.


#### 🔨 **Short Blunt Weapon**
*"Tools of creation turned instruments of correction."*

**Style:** Close-quarters brutality with improvised and purpose-built weapons

**Weapon Examples:**
- **Wrench Hammer:** Modified pipe wrench with weights welded on
- **Red Pan:** Heavy-duty cast iron cooking pan (mother's?)
- **Concrete Hammer:** Sledgehammer head wrapped in rebar
- **Short Pipe:** Metal pipe, perfect grip length
- **Brick on a Handle:** Literally a brick on a stick—simple, effective

**Short Blunt Identity:** Cengiz's practical side shows—he grabs what's at hand and makes it work. These weapons feel like extensions of his work-hardened hands.

---

#### 🪓 **Long Blunt Weapon**
*"Reach meets rage. Distance is just another obstacle to destroy."*

**Style:** Extended range devastation with two-handed weapons

**Weapon Examples:**
- **Hydra Hammer:** Fire hydrant welded to pipe with cloth grip
- **The Unbalanced:** Barbell loaded asymmetrically for spin momentum
- **Pipe Mace:** Long metal pipe with railing decoration on end
- **Street Sign on Pole:** Improvised polearm
- **Traffic Light Mace:** Entire traffic light fixture as hammer


**Progression Focus:**
- Area of effect expansion
- Momentum-based damage scaling
- Crowd control effectiveness
- Positioning advantage through range

**Long Blunt Identity:** Cengiz at maximum destructive potential. These weapons require his full strength to wield but reward him with devastating area control. He becomes a human wrecking ball, clearing entire groups with single swings.

## 💭 Philosophy Integration

### Philosophical Journey

**Point 1 & 2: Descent to Darkness (Eckhart/Jung)**
> "No tree can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell."

- Cengiz must confront his darkest self

- Cannot find peace without first facing fury
- **Gameplay:** Early stages are pure violence (the descent)

**Point 3: The Cycle (Buddha)**
> "The lesson continues until it is learned."

- Cengiz repeats the pattern: fight, temporary victory, more fighting
- Each death (roguelike) is another iteration
- Must recognize he's stuck in cycle
- **Gameplay:** Roguelike structure mirrors philosophical truth

**Point 4: Identity Revelation (Game Motto)**
> "No true self can emerge until every false identity is consumed by flame."

- Rage is the fire burning away false "peaceful construction worker"
- True self: Warrior blood, but with humanist wisdom
- Society's labels collapse, inheritance emerges
- **Gameplay:** Power growth parallels identity discovery
