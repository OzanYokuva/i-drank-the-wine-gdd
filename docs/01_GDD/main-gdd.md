## 🌟 Game Vision & Core Pillars

### Vision Statement

*"Society buries our true names under borrowed identities. Through righteous fury, we burn away these false layers—discovering we carry the blood of history's warriors, but inheriting not their rage, but their wisdom: that balance, not destruction, is the path forward."*

### Core Pillars

#### 1. **Meaningful Combat** 🥊
- Every strike has weight and impact
- Skill-based, timing-focused gameplay
- Fast, fluid, and deeply tactical
- Realistic combat physics with environmental interaction
- **THIS IS THE CORE** - Everything else enhances this

#### 2. **Reverse Narrative Discovery**
- Story told backwards—from reaction to cause
- Multiple heroes, multiple perspectives
- Gradually reveals the full picture of the cycle
- Each hero unaware of the others' struggles
- Players discover what anger prevents heroes from seeing

<details>
<summary>🚨 SPOILER: Narrative Revelation</summary>

**The twist:**
- Heroes believe they're destroyers of evil
- Gradually discover their fury perpetuates the cycle
- Effect → Evil → Reaction → Effect (endless loop)
- Final understanding: balance > destruction
- True role: balancers, not destroyers

</details>

#### 3. **Philosophical Depth & Identity** 📖
- Built on philosophical triangle (Eckhart, Jung, Buddha, Game Motto)
- Explores identity, inheritance, anger as purifying fire
- Heroes carry bloodlines of historical warriors
- Society's false identities vs. true inheritance
- Addresses real-world pressures that bury our true selves
- **Story enhances experience without affecting gameplay**
- Think of it as "an interactive book you punch your way through"

**Game Motto:**
> *"No true self can emerge until every false identity is consumed by flame."*

<details>
<summary>🚨 SPOILER: What Inheritance Means</summary>

**True inheritance:**
- Not about being destroyers like ancestors appeared to be
- About being balancers like ancestors truly were
- Historical heroes understood the necessity of opposition
- True wisdom = finding your role in eternal balance
- You don't destroy evil—you lock hands with it

</details>

#### 4. **Roguelike Replayability**
- Each run is unique
- Permanent skill progression
- Dynamic build creation through card system
- Risk and reward in every decision

## 🎮 Game Concept

### High Concept

*"Final Fight meets philosophical karma exploration—a skill-based brawler where you fight through cities consumed by corruption, experiencing a backwards narrative that reveals how evil perpetuates itself."*

### Core Theme: Identity, Inheritance & The Cycle of Anger

A silent invasion spreads across global cities. Behind a facade of peace, corruption rises, crime spreads, order collapses. Heroes rise independently—each carrying the blood of history's greatest warriors, though they've forgotten their true names.

**The Journey:**
- Society buried their true identities under false names
- Like Spirited Away's river spirit: forget your name, lose yourself
- Anger becomes the fire that burns away false layers
- Layer by layer: fury → frustration → doubt → self-awareness → new fury
- Eventually, true inheritance emerges from the ashes

**Playable Characters & Their Bloodlines:**
- **Cengiz** → Descendant of Hulagu Khan
- **[TBD]** → Bloodline of Joan of Arc
- **[TBD]** → Bloodline of Baldwin IV
- **[TBD]** → Bloodline of Richard the Lionheart
- **[TBD]** → Bloodline of Emilia Platter
- **[TBD]** → Bloodline of Hattori Hanzo

**Total: 6 playable heroes planned**

Each believes they fight a local battle, unaware they're all discovering the same truth through different lenses.

**Key Questions Explored:**
- Who are you when society's labels burn away?
- What does your bloodline truly teach you?
- Is fury the answer, or the question?
- Can you break a cycle by fighting, or only by understanding?

<details>
<summary>🚨 SPOILER: The Cycle's True Nature</summary>

**What players discover:**

The cycle isn't about good vs. evil—it's about balance vs. imbalance.

- Effect → Evil → Reaction → Effect (repeats endlessly)
- Heroes' righteous fury IS part of the cycle
- Fighting perpetuates what they oppose
- Evil cannot be destroyed, only balanced
- True inheritance: understanding your role as balancer
- Lock hands with opposition, don't annihilate it

**The "higher measure":**
Without understanding the complete cycle, your righteous actions become indistinguishable from evil. Good and evil collapse into the same shadow when you act from fury alone.

The higher measure = seeing the pattern and your place in it.

</details>

### Philosophy Framework: The Triangular Foundation

The game's philosophical depth is built on three interconnected pillars forming a conceptual triangle:

#### **Foundation (Point 1 & 2): Individual Transformation Through Darkness**

> *"Unless a man becomes nothing, God can make nothing of him."*  
> — Meister Eckhart

> *"No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell."*  
> — Carl Jung

**Thematic Purpose:**  
These quotes form the base of our philosophical triangle. They represent the hero's journey—the necessity of confronting one's darkest moments, accepting complete vulnerability, and witnessing the worst of reality before true understanding can emerge. Every hero in our story must "become nothing" and let their "roots reach hell" before they can see beyond their anger.

**Jung's True Meaning:**  
This is an **internal journey** to your darkest self—shadow work, confronting suppressed aspects of yourself. Like Dante's Inferno: you must descend to the bottom to escape. Not about witnessing external evil, but facing the darkness buried within.

**Narrative Application:**  
- Heroes start consumed by righteous fury
- Each must face their personal "hell"—their own shadows
- Through losing everything false, they find what's real
- Transformation requires complete vulnerability and ego death

#### **Point 3: The Cycle Continues Until Understood**

> *"The lesson continues until it is learned."*  
> — Buddha

**Thematic Purpose:**  
Represents the roguelike nature of both gameplay and narrative. The cycle of anger, reaction, and effect repeats endlessly until its true nature is understood. Players experience this through repeated runs, each revealing more truth.

**Anger's Layers:**  
Anger → Frustration → Doubt → Self-awareness → New anger (cycle repeats until understood)

**Narrative Application:**  
- The cycle of corruption perpetuates itself
- Heroes repeat their struggles until they see the full picture
- Each playthrough reveals new layers
- Understanding breaks the cycle, not violence alone

#### **Point 4 (Game Motto): The Collapse of False Identity**

> *"No true self can emerge until every false identity is consumed by flame."*  
> — I Drank The Wine: Inheritance

**Thematic Purpose:**  
The core revelation. Society forces names, labels, identities upon us. Like Spirited Away's river spirit forgetting its name, we forget who we truly are. Anger becomes the fire that burns away false layers, revealing the inheritance beneath.

**The Journey:**
```
False identity (what society calls you)
    ↓ (anger burns layer)
Fears and anxieties
    ↓ (anger burns layer)
Suppressed true self
    ↓ (anger burns layer)
INHERITANCE - Your true name
```

**Narrative Application:**  
- Heroes carry bloodlines of historical warriors
- But they've forgotten who they truly are
- Society buried their true names under false identities
- Anger strips away these false layers, one by one
- Eventually: they remember

<details>
<summary>🚨 SPOILER: Complete Philosophical Resolution</summary>

### How These Pillars Work Together

```
                    Buddha (Cycle)
                          △
                         ╱ ╲

Eckhart/Jung ────────────────────── Balance
(Foundation)                        (Resolution)
```

**The philosophical triangle guides both narrative structure and player experience:**

1. **Foundation (Eckhart/Jung):** Heroes must hit rock bottom, face their darkest selves
2. **Cycle (Buddha):** Pattern repeats until understood through anger's layers
3. **Identity (Motto):** False identities burn away, true inheritance emerges
4. **Resolution:** Only complete understanding reveals the truth

**The ultimate revelation:**
- Evil cannot be destroyed, only balanced
- Heroes are not destroyers, but authentic selves finding their place
- True inheritance = being yourself, which naturally creates balance
- Lock hands with opposition, don't annihilate it
- Your ancestors were themselves—that's what made them perfect pieces

**"Higher Measure" Quote (Supporting Philosophy):**
> *"Without a higher measure, good and evil collapse into the same shadow."*

Without understanding the complete cycle, righteous fury becomes indistinguishable from evil. The "higher measure" is seeing the pattern and being your authentic self within it—then choosing balance over destruction.

### Narrative Structure: Reverse Discovery

Unlike traditional narratives, **I Drank The Wine** begins at the *reaction* and works backwards to the *cause*:

1. **Start:** Heroes fighting against visible evil (gangs, corruption, decay)
2. **Progress:** Discovering connections between events
3. **Revelation:** Understanding the cycle that created this evil
4. **Climax:** Confronting the root cause
5. **Resolution:** Player's interpretation of the complete cycle

Each playable character has their own perspective and story, unaware of the others, yet all are pieces of the same larger narrative.

- A stage in the narrative
- A unique cultural perspective on the invasion
- Distinct visual and gameplay identity
- Connection to the larger story

**Demo City: Paris**
