## 🎮 Game Concept

### High Concept

*"Final Fight meets philosophical karma exploration—a skill-based brawler where you fight through cities consumed by corruption, experiencing a backwards narrative that reveals how evil perpetuates itself."*

### Core Theme: Karma & The Cycle of Evil

The game explores a silent invasion spreading across global cities. Behind a facade of peace, corruption rises, crime spreads, and order collapses. Players witness the reaction—heroes rising to fight—but gradually discover the causes, seeing how effect, evil, and reaction form an endless cycle.

**Key Questions Explored:**
- What creates the evil we fight against?
- How does righteous anger blind us to larger truths?
- Can breaking the cycle start with understanding it?
- What role does the individual play in systemic corruption?

### Philosophy Framework: The Triangular Foundation

The game's philosophical depth is built on three interconnected pillars forming a conceptual triangle:

#### **Foundation (Point 1 & 2): Individual Transformation Through Darkness**

> *"Unless a man becomes nothing, God can make nothing of him."*  
> — Meister Eckhart

> *"No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell."*  
> — Carl Jung

**Thematic Purpose:**  
These quotes form the base of our philosophical triangle. They represent the hero's journey—the necessity of confronting one's darkest moments, accepting complete vulnerability, and witnessing the worst of reality before true understanding can emerge. Every hero in our story must "become nothing" and let their "roots reach hell" before they can see beyond their anger.

**Narrative Application:**  
- Heroes start consumed by righteous fury
- Each must face their personal "hell"
- Through losing everything, they gain clarity
- Transformation requires complete vulnerability

#### **Point 3: The Cycle Continues Until Understood**

> *"The lesson continues until it is learned."*  
> — Buddha

**Thematic Purpose:**  
Represents the roguelike nature of both gameplay and narrative. The cycle of evil, reaction, and effect repeats endlessly until its true nature is understood. Players experience this through repeated runs, each revealing more of the truth.

**Narrative Application:**  
- The cycle of corruption perpetuates itself
- Heroes repeat their struggles until they see the full picture
- Each playthrough reveals new layers
- Understanding breaks the cycle, not violence alone

#### **Point 4 (Game Motto): The Collapse of Moral Certainty**

> *"Without a higher measure, good and evil collapse into the same shadow."*  
> — I Drank The Wine

**Thematic Purpose:**  
The philosophical twist and ultimate revelation. When heroes act purely from anger without understanding the complete cycle, their "righteous" actions become indistinguishable from the evil they fight. This is the game's central revelation—delivered gradually through the reverse narrative.

**Narrative Application:**  
- Heroes believe they fight for justice
- Without seeing the full cycle, their fury perpetuates it
- The "higher measure" is complete understanding
- The twist: heroes are part of the problem they fight

### How These Pillars Work Together

```
                    Buddha (Cycle)
                          △
                         ╱ ╲
                        ╱   ╲

Eckhart/Jung ────────────────────── Gameplay Loop
(Foundation)                        (Revelation)
```

The philosophical triangle guides both narrative structure and player experience:
1. **Foundation (Eckhart/Jung):** Heroes must hit rock bottom
2. **Cycle (Buddha):** Pattern repeats until understood  
3. **Twist (Motto):** Righteous fury without wisdom = more evil
4. **Resolution:** Only complete understanding breaks the cycle

### Narrative Structure: Reverse Discovery

Unlike traditional narratives, **I Drank The Wine** begins at the *reaction* and works backwards to the *cause*:

1. **Start:** Heroes fighting against visible evil (gangs, corruption, decay)
2. **Progress:** Discovering connections between events
3. **Revelation:** Understanding the cycle that created this evil
4. **Climax:** Confronting the root cause
5. **Resolution:** Player's interpretation of the complete cycle

Each playable character has their own perspective and story, unaware of the others, yet all are pieces of the same larger narrative.

## 🌍 World & Setting

### The Silent Invasion

A subtle corruption spreads across the world's major cities. On the surface, life continues—but beneath, crime flourishes, order crumbles, and darkness grows. No single villain, no obvious enemy—just a pervasive decay of society.

Heroes rise independently in different cities, each believing they fight a local battle, unaware they're all pieces of a global cycle.

### Cities as Battlegrounds

Each city represents:
- A stage in the narrative
- A unique cultural perspective on the invasion
- Distinct visual and gameplay identity
- Connection to the larger story

**Demo City: Paris**
- Starting point of player's journey
- Represents the visible reaction to corruption
- 3 playable stages showcasing core mechanics

**Planned Cities:**
- **Istanbul:** [Narrative role TBD]
- **London:** [Narrative role TBD]
- **Tokyo:** [Narrative role TBD]
